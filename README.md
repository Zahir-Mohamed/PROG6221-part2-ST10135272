Upgrades and New Features
Unlimited Number of Recipes: The application now allows users to enter an unlimited number of recipes. Users can create multiple recipes and manage them separately.

Recipe Name: Users can assign a unique name to each recipe. This allows for better identification and organization of recipes.

List of Recipes in Alphabetical Order: The application now displays a list of all the recipes in alphabetical order by their names. This makes it easier for users to locate and select a specific recipe.
